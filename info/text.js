    ### **Summary**
    
    I have worked for startup, medium sized and big companies and I have learned a lot from all of them. I have become a frontend specialist with 8+ years of experience building web applications and have acquired a strong set of tools and technologies to bring success into any project. I enjoy creating amazing products that increases company revenue, improves customer satisfaction, or reduce company expenses.

    - Is a team player
    - Is honest, commited and hard worker
    - Has a positive attitude
    - Is versatile regarding tech stuff, frontend specialist, but with a decent background in the backend side (node/express/mongo)
